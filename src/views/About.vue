    <p style="text-align: left">Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my code. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
    <p style="text-align: left">
      I'm a super anxious tech nerd who loves to code. I enjoy learning new things and solving problems. 
      I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.
      As a result, I have a lot of fun picking up new languages and frameworks. 
      Just about anything is possible! You just have to be curious.
